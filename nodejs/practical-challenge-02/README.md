## About

In this challenge you will develop an API to perform CRUD of your _tasks_.
The API must contain the following functionalities:

- [x] Creation of a task
- [x] List of all tasks
- [x] Update a task by `id`
- [x] Remove a task by `id`
- [x] Mark a task as complete by `id`
- [x] And the real challenge: Importing tasks in bulk via a CSV file

<br>

## Business requirements and Routes (endpoints) <a name="business"></a>

Before the routes, let's understand what structure (properties) a task should have:

- `id` - Unique identifier for each task
- `title` - Task title
- `description` - Detailed description of the task
- `completed_at` - Date when the task was completed. The initial value must be `null`
- `created_at` - Date when the task was created.
- `updated_at` - Must always be changed to the date when the task was updated.

**Routes:**

<details>
  <summary>POST /tasks</summary>

- [x] It must be possible to create a user
</details>

<br>

## Extra mile

- [x] Validate whether the `title` and `description` properties of the `POST` and `PUT` routes are present in the `body` of the request.
- [x] In routes that receive `/:id`, in addition to validating whether the `id` exists in the database, return the request with a message stating that the record does not exist.
